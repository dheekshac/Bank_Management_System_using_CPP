# Problem Statement  
Managing bank accounts manually can be time consuming, error prone, and inefficient, especially when dealing with multiple customers and transactions. There is a need for a simple, reliable, and organized system that can handle basic banking operations while ensuring data persistence and accuracy.  

# Description
This project aims to develop a console based Banking Management System using C++ that allows users to create and manage bank accounts efficiently. The system provides essential banking functionalities such as opening accounts, depositing and withdrawing money, checking account balances, closing accounts, and viewing all existing accounts.  
To ensure data is not lost between program executions, the system uses file handling to store and retrieve account information permanently. The application is designed using Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to improve code readability, modularity, and maintainability.

# Objectives
-To design a menu-driven banking application using C++  
-To implement core banking operations in a structured manner  
-To ensure secure handling of transactions with minimum balance constraints  
-To store and retrieve account data using file handling  
-To apply OOP concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, and reusability
